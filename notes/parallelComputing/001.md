## Pointer remember

A process can be divided into four sections, such as text, stack, data, etc


To load a process into memory, there are techniques, such as paging and segmentation.



```c
int i;
int *p;

i = 5;
p = &i;

*p = 7;
(*p)++;
p = (int*)(0x44);
```



```c
int []arr = {1,2,3,4};
int *pv;

arr[2]++;

pv = &arr;

pv[2]++;

pv += 2;

(*pb)++;

pv+= 2
```


```c
int add(int x, int y){
    return x + y;
};

int main(void){
    int (*p)(int, int) = &add;
    printf("%d", p(1, 2));
}
```
